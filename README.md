## About
I've been programming for a long time, however my first non-procedural program was BlackJack for an interview written in C#. I've not touched the language since then.
I tutored someone in computer science who now works for NASA.
There's a strange knack for finding security problems. *I've been accused of being a corporate spy for reporting 3 on my first day at a company -- which makes no sense to me, why would I report it if it were true*
I'm able to figure out how something works as long as I'm allowed to play with it.
Top Secret Clearance clearable.
